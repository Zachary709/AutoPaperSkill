# Source And Ranking Policy

Use this file when the user asks for topic-based discovery, venue scraping, or cross-source enrichment.

## Research Direction Mode

Default search order:

1. arXiv for recent paper discovery
2. Semantic Scholar for citations and author-level impact signals
3. Additional MCP or web sources only when they improve coverage materially

The active agent performs these lookups through conversation-available web, search, MCP, or browser tools. Do not delegate external source access to bundled scripts.

Default workflow:

1. Build a candidate pool larger than the final shortlist.
2. Normalize every candidate into the paper schema.
3. Remove duplicates against the local library first.
4. Remove duplicates inside the current batch.
5. Apply the dynamic citation heuristic below.
6. Present the shortlist before saving unless the user requested direct save.

## Dynamic Citation Heuristic

This is a default heuristic for ranking or filtering topic-search results:

- age `0-1` years: no hard minimum; prefer early-traction papers
- age `2-3` years: prefer `>= 5` citations
- age `4-5` years: prefer `>= 15` citations
- age `> 5` years: prefer `>= 30` citations

Relax the thresholds when:

- the area is very new
- the field has low citation velocity
- the user explicitly wants frontier work regardless of citations

When you relax the heuristic, say so explicitly in the answer.

## Venue Mode

Use venue mode only when the user provides:

- a venue name
- one year or a comma-separated year list

Preferred source order:

1. official conference site, journal site, or official proceedings page
2. official publisher table of contents
3. OpenReview when the venue uses it
4. field-specific official archives such as ACL Anthology
5. DBLP or other index pages only as a discovery fallback

Rules:

- Mark `is_official: true` only for official venue, proceedings, or publisher pages.
- If you use a fallback source, mark `is_official: false`.
- For every year, keep the landing page you used in `metadata_sources`.
- Do not claim that a venue page is official unless the domain or page ownership clearly supports it.
- If the venue uses OpenReview and OpenReview exposes a PDF or official attachment, use that OpenReview resource for PDF download before considering arXiv.
- If the first OpenReview PDF request fails, continue troubleshooting the OpenReview route first.
- Do not silently substitute an arXiv PDF when an OpenReview PDF exists. If retrieval remains blocked, state that explicitly.

## Specific Paper Mode

Preferred resolution order:

1. DOI
2. arXiv ID
3. exact title
4. fuzzy title

PDF retrieval rule:

1. OpenReview PDF or attachment when available
2. publisher or official proceedings PDF
3. arXiv PDF only when no OpenReview or other official PDF is available

If OpenReview has a PDF resource, do not downgrade to arXiv merely because the first OpenReview attempt failed.

Metadata enrichment rule:

1. Use OpenReview for official paper page, venue notes, and required PDF when available.
2. Continue with Semantic Scholar for paper citation count, author affiliations, author citation counts, h-index, and author IDs when available.
3. Continue with Crossref for DOI, publication date, publisher venue, and landing page when available.
4. Continue with arXiv for arXiv ID, preprint date, abstract, and PDF alternatives only when OpenReview/official PDF is not available.
5. Record every checked source in `metadata_sources` and summarize missing important fields in `metadata_enrichment_status`.

OpenReview priority is a PDF-source rule, not a reason to stop DOI, arXiv, citation, or author-impact enrichment.

## External Access Boundary

External source access belongs to the active agent, not helper scripts.

- The active agent may use available web/search/MCP/browser tools to inspect OpenReview, Semantic Scholar, Crossref, arXiv, official venue pages, publisher pages, or other reliable indexes.
- Do not add or run bundled scripts whose job is to call external paper APIs or scrape external sites.
- After the active agent retrieves source evidence, it may save the relevant JSON payload, page facts, or normalized excerpt locally.
- `scripts/metadata_enricher.py` may merge those local payloads deterministically, but it must not be treated as a network fetcher.
- Record every checked source in `metadata_sources`, including the source URL, retrieved date when available, fields used, and whether the source was official.

If a title-only query yields multiple plausible matches:

- show the best 2-5 candidates
- ask before saving

## Duplicate Rules

Apply these rules in order:

1. `paper_id` exact match
2. normalized title exact match
3. normalized title similarity `>= 0.92`

Normalization means:

- Unicode normalized
- accents removed
- lowercase
- punctuation removed
- whitespace collapsed

## High-Impact Author Heuristic

Mark an author as high-impact only when you have explicit evidence such as:

- citation count `>= 10000`
- h-index `>= 40`
- another reliable, source-backed equivalent signal

When reporting a high-impact coauthor, include:

- name
- affiliation when known
- metric used
- evidence source

Do not infer a corresponding author from author order. Use explicit source evidence, or report that the corresponding author was not reliably identified.

## Attribution Rules

- Keep field-level provenance in `metadata_sources` when possible.
- Do not silently replace conflicting values.
- Prefer cautious notes over unsupported certainty for indexing or venue claims.
